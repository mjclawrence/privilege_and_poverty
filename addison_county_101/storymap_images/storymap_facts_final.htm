<article>
    This site summarizes the economic and social conditions related to poverty and economic inequality in Vermont. These are complicated and complex issues with multidimensional causes and effects. Our analyses touch on only some of those factors, highlighting education, food insecurity, housing, and health and wellness. Geographically, we focus on Addison County, home to Middlebury College. We compare Addison County to Vermont's thirteen other counties and dig deeper into conditions in Addison County's twenty-three towns. All measures for counties and towns come from the American Community Survey's 2018 5-year estimates, unless otherwise noted.
    
    Throughout this site, we include excerpts from a 2015 report co-authored by Pamela Berenbaum, Professor of the Practice at Middlebury College and coordinator of Global Health Programs, and Alessandria Schumacher, Middlebury College Class of 2017. Their report, titled "Local Determinants of Health in Addison County," provides valuable insights into the breadth of issues affecting life in Addison County. We share pieces of those interviews here to bring in voices of community members and local experts.
    
    We also include profiles of local organizations working to address the challenges associated with poverty and economic inequality in Addison County. Many of these community partners host summer internships affiliated with Middlebury College's Privilege &amp; Poverty Academic Cluster. We share reflections from the student interns as well as staff from the organizations.

     <p>Vermont is known to have an aging population. Compared to the country overall, the state has a higher percentage of residents 65 years of age or older and a lower percentage of children under the age of 18.
    </p>
    
    The data highlights that 1 in 5 persons in Vermont are over 65 years of age. Additionally, 35% of the population is 55 year of age and older. Yet some counties in Vermont have age profiles that closely match the patterns in the national distribution.
<p></p>


    <p>Addison County has the second highest percentage of individuals under 24 years old, driven largely by the presence of Middlebury College.

            The town of Middlebury is considered the heart of Addison County with a flourishing downtown, the largest population in the area, and home to Middlebury College. It is such a combination of factors that makes Middlebury the most diverse place in Addison County.
        </p>

        <p>
            Middlebury is the most racially and ethnically diverse town in Addison County. Yet like the rest of the county and state, Middlebury is predominantly white. Approximately 84% of Middlebury residents identify as white, which is substantially less than the total percentage of white persons in Vermont (93%). The town's relative diversity is most likely a result of Middlebury College's presence in the community, as the institution attracts some students, staff, and faculty from marginalized racial identities.
        </p>

        <p>
            For some reference of the lack of diversity in Middlebury, consider this comparison: the 16% of Middlebury residents who are non-white (of any race or ethnicity) make up roughly the same share of the US population that are Hispanic/Latinx persons.
        </p>

        <p>

            Approximately 9% of Middlebury residents are foreign-born, which is about double the rate in Addison County and statewide. The foreign-born rate in Middlebury is lower than the US rate of 13.7%. Again, the relatively high rate of foreign-born individuals in the town may be influenced by Middlebury College, which attracts international students and employees to the community.
        </p>

        <p>
            Further, the iconic dairy industry in Vermont attracts significant amounts of migrant farmworkers to local communities. The demand for cheap labor attracts an estimated 1,200 to 1,500 migrant farmworkers - many of whom are undocumented - to Addison County. Migration patterns in Addison County parallel migration processes nationally and globally. Some migrants feel a "pull" to Vermont because established familial networks on the state's dairy farms may ease the social and cultural dislocation of migration and provide opportunities for economic advancement. In other cases, Vermont becomes an option after migrants feel "pushed" to escape political destabilization, violence, poverty, or danger to themselves and their families.

<h2> Economic Inequality </h2>

<section>
    <article>
        Economic inequality is a general term that may refer to gaps in income, wealth, or the ability to pay for basic needs like food and shelter. The effects of such inequality are especially amplified in communities of color and among individuals and families with other marginalized backgrounds.

        The national profile of Senator Bernie Sanders often links Vermont to issues of economic inequality [1]. By comparing the measures Senator Sanders highlights, this report from the Economic Policy Institute shows that income inequality exists in Vermont. For example, Vermonters in the top 1% of the income distribution earn 14% of the state's income. On average, their incomes are more than 16 times greater than the incomes of the bottom 99% in Vermont.

        As striking as those numbers are, there is less income inequality in Vermont than in other states. In fact, the EPI report ranked Vermont 43rd of the 50 states when measuring income inequality by the Gini Index. Every county in Vermont had Gini coefficients lower than the national measure of 0.49. Income inequality is highest in Lamoille County and lowest in Orange, Franklin, and Addison Counties.

        How do economic conditions in Addison County relate to economic inequality in the state and nation? To understand economic inequality a little more, this section examines household incomes, poverty rates, and deep poverty rates at the national, state, county, and town levels.

            Addison County's median household income is higher than the national median ($61,937) and state median ($60,782). The median is the middle point in the income distribution, so 50% of households in Addison County have incomes higher than $65,093.
        </p>

        <p>
            Median household income in Vermont varies regionally.
        </p>

        <p>
            Northwest Vermont is the most metropolitan area in the state with a diversifying economy and about 35% of the population. Median household income is greater than $60,000 in all Northwestern counties, with the state's highest median household income in Chittenden County.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast, Northeast Vermont (known as the Northeast Kingdom), comprising only 10% of the state's population, is the most rural part of Vermont. Median household incomes in Essex, Caledonia, and Orleans Counties all fall below $50,000.

            Official measures count's someone as living in poverty if their income is below the threshold amount for the size of their family unit. Individuals and families below the poverty threshold are often unable to access basic necessities such as food, water, shelter, education, and health care. When someone is in "deep poverty," their income is less than 50% of their poverty threshold. In 2018, a family of four in deep poverty had an income below $12,550.

            The distinction between being in or out of poverty is a technical one that obscures much of the experience of economic insecurity. By looking at how far incomes fall from the poverty threshold, we are able to see important nuances in poverty data, like the percent of people near poverty, by which we mean having incomes within 100% and 125% of the poverty threshold.
        </p>

        <p>
            Approximately 14 million persons in the US are near poverty. In Vermont, over 20,000 people are near poverty.
        </p>

        <p>
            The near poverty rate in the US is greater than Vermont's near poverty rate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Addison County has the third lowest rate of residents near poverty. At the same time, three-quarters of Addison County residents live 200% or more above the poverty line.
        </p>

        <p>
            Essex county has the highest proportion of individuals near poverty and the lowest proportion of residents who are 200% or more above the poverty line.

            The town of Middlebury (where Middlebury College is located) has a median household income less than the national, state, and county medians.
        </p>

        <p>
            Middlebury's median household income is lower than the median household incomes in seventeen other towns in Addison County. As discussed when comparing age distributions across Addison County towns, Middlebury's measures may be skewed by its large number of college students.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are great disparities in income among the towns of Addison County. The gap between the town with the lowest median household income (Ripton) and the highest (Monkton) totals $42,165.
        </p>

        <p>
            Economic privilege and its benefits are unevenly distributed across towns, and Addison County's overall economic rewards are inaccessible to many of its residents.

<h3> Community Voices: Economic Inequality in Addison County </h3>

<section>
    <article>
        <p>
            Economic inequality featured prominently in the 2015 report co-authored by Pamela Berenbaum, Professor of the Practice at Middlebury College and coordinator of Global Health Programs, and Alessandria Schumacher, Middlebury College Class of 2017. One of the most common topics mentioned in the interviews with community members and local experts was the income divide in Addison County. Residents expressed a notion of "two Middleburys or two Addison Counties", where half of the residents are "people who are well off, employed in well-paying jobs, and living in comfortable houses" while the other half are "people working low-paying, unskilled, unstable jobs."
        </p>

        <p>
            There is evidence that these gaps have been increasing. A 2012 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities revealed a growing divide between the rich and poor in Vermont. The richest 20% of Vermonters have seen a 75% increase in economic growth, while the poorest 20% have only seen a 32% increase in growth. Further, the richest 5% of households have an average income that is 9.6 times greater than the poorest 20% of households.
        </p>

        <p>
            Further, individuals living in Addison county with low and moderate incomes face additional challenges. Their incomes may be too high to qualify for government assistance reserved for those living in poverty, yet they are not high enough to enjoy comfortable, financially stable lives. Residents in the 2015 report felt that this aid system "is one that forces people into poverty to get services, rather than assists those in the lower-middle income bracket to get them solidly out of poverty." As a result, poverty persists for many residents, and the divide between high income and low-income residents continues.

<h3> Community Partner Profile: Helping Overcome Poverty's Effects (H.O.P.E.) </h3>

<section>
    <article>
        How has the community responded to issues of economic inequality? One of the main organizations in Addison County combating poverty's effects is HOPE. Their mission is to "improve the lives of low-income people in Addison County, Vermont by working with individuals to identify and secure the resources needed to meet their basic needs" [2]. In addition to food relief, HOPE also provides the education and financial assistance to combat the effects of unfair and low wages. Jaime Donnelly, a Middlebury College student and Privilege &amp; Poverty intern with HOPE in 2020, shared that the organization provides financial assistance "to aid people in getting things such as stoves or heat or any other appliances. We also write vouchers for laundry, gas and appliances which allows people to access these things that they wouldn't normally be able to" [3]. In addition, HOPE provides budget counseling for individuals who hope to better manage their limited incomes, as well as grant job-assistance to help individuals apply or keep a paying position.

<h2> Education </h2>

<section>
    <article>
        Vermont Governor Ernest Gibson (1947-1950) said, "the very existence of civilization as we know it depends upon our youth securing the very best education that it is in our power to give" [4]. Such enthusiasm has allowed Vermont to have arguably some of the best public schools in the country. However, Vermont's educational successes are uneven. The state has one of the highest high school completion rates in the country but one of the lowest rates of high school graduates entering college. These patterns are important to explain because poverty greatly affects educational attainment and education itself is a major factor in moving individuals out of poverty.

        In the following section, we will look at two indicators of educational attainment: the percentage of the population with a high school diploma (including equivalency) or higher and the percentage of the population with a bachelor's degree or higher. We will also profile the work of Addison Central Teens Center, an organization in Middlebury committed to providing local students with the resources they need to thrive in school and beyond.

        The analyses in this section are general. For more details about educational outcomes across Vermont's counties and school districts, we recommend using the tool linked below created by the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University.

<h3> Community Partner Profile: Addison Central Teens Center</h3>

<section>
    <article>
        The 2015 report noted that many local residents feel that educational programs and resources are available but are not widely used. One organization succeeding in providing those resources is the Addison Central Teens Center (ACTC), located in Middlebury. ACTC creates a safe, affirming environment for teens while providing programming for Addison County youth. According to Cicilia Robison, Executive Director of ACTC, "It has been shown that both having access to (and using) a substance free space, as well as feeling supported by adults in one's life, positively impacts youth's educational outcomes" [5].

        Sam Collins, a Middlebury College student and 2020 P&amp;P intern at ACTC, spoke about how the non-profit has been able to educationally enrich teens. During his internship, the group dedicated one week to different subjects including cooking, the outdoors, STEM, and art, making this programming as informative as possible for all participants. Further, Collins shared that they embraced Pride month by posting celebratory content on social media, as well as detailed infographics on a variety of monumental LGBT+ court cases, from Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) to One, Inc. v. Olesen (1958). Collins expressed the importance of sharing this sort of educational content given "LGBT youth in rural Vermont aren't exposed to [this material]" [6].

        Robison shared the non-profit will soon begin providing some important life skills classes. Material will include financial literacy classes, education on how to prepare for college, and job interview sessions. The group aims to offer sexual health education in the coming years as well. "All of this increases protective factors for youth and provides some of the tools that they need in order to escape the cycle of poverty," said Robison.

<h2> Food Insecurity</h2>

<section>
    <article>
        Food insecurity is a complex social and economic condition in which access to food is limited or uncertain because of cost or other barriers. This issue often intersects with other forms of economic and social inequality such as low wages, housing insecurity, and high medical costs. Additionally, food insecurity tends to disproportionately affect communities of color and households headed by a single female parent.

        To assess food needs in Addison County, we will summarize data about usage of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). SNAP provides families who qualify with funds to buy nutritional foods in order to maintain good health. However, many individuals facing food insecurity may not qualify for these benefits. Local organizations such as HOPE, John Graham Housing and Services, Charter House Coalition, and Middlebury College provide additional resources for Addison County residents facing food insecurity.

<h3> Community Voices: Food and Nutrition in Addison County</h3>

<section>
    <article>
        Community members interviewed for the 2015 report mentioned positive things about food availability. The report states: "Several people noted options for local foods such as farmers markets and community-supported agriculture (CSA's)." Additionally, many community members expressed the health-conscious culture in schools, among younger people, in food assistance programs, and among the general public. However, there are still many barriers to accessing these fresh and nutritious foods, as the quote below from one community member demonstrates:

        "You can see the difference between families where one kid will have fruits and veggies and a really healthy 7-grain sun butter and jelly sandwich and then we have another family, and they bring in a can of Spaghetti-Os. It's easier, and sadly, it's cheaper, to buy that can of Spaghetti-Os than to buy those fresh fruits and veggies."

        For lower-middle class community members, who don't qualify for SNAP yet don't have high incomes, it seems as if affording locally grown foods is challenging. Furthermore, the report highlighted the lack of knowledge about good nutrition, which can inhibit individuals from making the decision to choose healthy foods.

        In addition to providing financial services, HOPE runs one of the largest food shelves in the state serving over 600 people every month. The shelf includes typical non-perishable canned foods as well as meat, eggs, dairy products, and unmarketable fruits and vegetables.
        
        Kerry Conley of HOPE expressed that the food shelf is essential and meets the needs of residents when SNAP is insufficient. "We see an increase certainly in how many families come through [the food shelf] at the end of the month because food stamps don't supplement the whole month by any means. Your food bill is usually far beyond how much you get for your food stamps. It just doesn't stretch," she said [7]. Jaime Donnelly, a 2020 P&amp;P summer intern at HOPE, shared how wonderful it was to help with food deliveries and pantry restocking, especially during a pandemic [8].

        Another organization working to alleviate food insecurity is John Graham Housing and Services. John Graham has provided services from housing to food aid for the homeless since 1980. During the Covid-19 pandemic, John Graham has been working hard to provide three meals a day for the homeless. "There was a lot of fear at the beginning," said Jubilee McGill, a front-line volunteer with John Graham tasked with delivering food. "How are we going to eat? How will our children get what they need? Food is so essential to survival. Once people knew they were safe, that they had a place to stay and 3 meals a day, they felt a lot of peace," she said [9].

<h3> Spotlight: Food Insecurity at Middlebury College</h3>

<section>
    <article>
        Molly Anderson, Professor of Food Studies at Middlebury College, surveyed Middlebury College students about food insecurity. The survey found that nearly 1 in 10 students did not have enough food to eat. In response to this surprising data, Middlebury College students Molly Babbin (‘22), Bella Pucker (‘21.5), and Grace Weissman (‘21.5) compiled a resource guide to help students find food aid programs throughout Vermont. "There's definitely that kind of idea that Middlebury, oh you know, we have this sort of unlimited dining plan… that we have a wealthy student body, even though that's just a stereotype and not necessarily true," said Babbin. "It's these sorts of ideas floating around that make people think, 'oh food insecurity is not a big problem at Middlebury'" [10]. Their Food Resource Guide for Middlebury aims to help food insecure students find the resources they need to eat well and stay healthy and is available to all community members who may need it.

<h2> Housing </h2>

<section>
    <article>
        For most Americans, housing provides safety, security, shelter, and the accumulation of wealth, yet also constitutes a major expense. It is not surprising, then, that housing instability has the power to severely harm the economic, physical, and mental health of families across the nation. Research suggests housing instability is linked with a family's inability to access basic needs like clothing, food, and medicine, and can cause depression in adults and children. For children, there is more evidence suggesting that homelessness and unstable housing can lead to child neglect and abuse, and that evictions and moving can lead to lower test scores and decreased attendance rates. Such findings have led Princeton Professor Matthew Desmond to state that "eviction is a cause, not just a consequence, of poverty" [11]. To learn more about eviction and poverty nationally, visit the Eviction Lab linked below.

        To what extent are Vermonters in Addison County affected by housing instability? In this section, we compare owner-occupied housing rates to further understand how this issue impacts residents. We will also profile the work of John Graham Housing and Services, the Charter House Coalition, and Addison County Community Trust.

        By looking at owner-occupied housing rates at the national, state, county, and town levels, we are able to examine what share of people in various geographical areas own homes. Note that the reasons for high or low ownership rates are varied and nuanced, and we cannot make any confident suggestions looking solely at this data.
    </article>

    <article>
        <p>
            The US owner-occupied housing rate is less than Vermont's rate. Addison County residents have a higher owner-occupied housing rate than both the US and Vermont.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of all counties, Grand Isle has the highest rate of owner-occupied housing, whereas Chittenden has the lowest rate.

        Chittenden County has the highest median rent and highest median value of housing. Furthermore, the county has highest rate of renter-occupied housing in all of Vermont. Chittenden residents also spend the highest percentage of their incomes on housing in all of Vermont.
    </article>

    <article>
        <p>
            These high costs of housing are most likely influenced by Chittenden's diverse economy, large population, and metropolitan setting.

        <p>
            Addison County's median rent is greater than the state's median, and is the 2nd second highest median rent in the State. Additionally, Addison has second highest median value of housing.

<h3> Community Voices: Housing in Addison County</h3>

<section>
    <article>
        The 2015 report analyzed the community's perception of local housing issues. One interviewee stated that "housing seems to be the biggest stress on service users," with many more commenting on the lack of affordability and availability of housing in Addison County. The report found that some of the groups most vulnerable to housing insecurity in Addison County include those who are elderly, low-income, mentally ill, and struggling with addiction.
        
        When it comes to emergency housing, community members highlighted the need for more temporary shelters for those who are housing insecure: "Some people end up living in hotels paid for by the state, which is costly for the state and probably not the best solution for the people living there.

<h3> Community Partner Profile: John Graham Housing and Services</h3>

        At John Graham Housing and Services, volunteers and staff work rapidly to re-house people so they can get back on their feet. To do that, the shelter creates a space where individuals do not feel judged and instead fully heard and welcomed. "It really helps when you got people around you that just accept you, you know? There's no judgement," said Jackson, a recipient of aid services through John Graham [12]. Elizabeth Ready, the Chief Financial Officer of John Graham, shared a glimpse of how they serve: "We help people articulate their own goals," she said, "but before somebody can do that, they have to feel that they are going to be heard" [13].
        
        John Graham currently has five shelters located in the towns of Vergennes, Middlebury, and Bristol, allowing the non-profit to house up to 75 people at a given time. They also provide families and individuals with food, job opportunities, and financial literacy courses, while supporting them on their journey to find permanent housing.

<h3> Community Partner Profile: The Charter House Coalition</h3>

    <article>
        In addition to community meals, the Charter House Coalition also provides emergency housing for people who are homeless and connects individuals at risk of homelessness with services and programs. The shelter is able to house individuals and families year round, keeping people off the street during the extremely cold winter months. 

        The Charter House, in partnership with HOPE and the Counseling Center of Addison County, hopes to expand the housing options in Addison County through their "Tiny Homes" project. This project will begin to fill two needs in the community: the availability of housing in general and the availability of affordable housing that low-income individuals can access. They are seeking 2 acres of land to build ten to fifteen mobile homes that will be about 500 square feet. The tiny homes will be near downtown Middlebury (to provide easy access to transportation and jobs), will be affordable for low-income persons, and will be equipped with solar panels.
        
        Doug Sinclair, co-director of the Charter House Coalition, summarized the need for the project: "If you make minimum wage, you cannot afford to live in Middlebury, and you need a vehicle too. We are trying to help those who need a stable way to live. I can tell you that half of the people in Charter House shelters have jobs and can't afford to live in the community" [14].

<h2> Health and Wellness</h2>

<section>
    <article>
        The 2010 Affordable Care Act expanded funding for the federal government and state governments to provide subsidies to effectively lower the cost of health insurance and make healthcare more accessible. Research suggests this Obama-era legislation led to an increase in health care coverage, improved health care affordability and financial stability for low-income families, and even led to an increase in employment. This body of evidence highlights how access to affordable health care can assist in the reduction of challenges associated with poverty.
        
        Nonetheless, many people remain underinsured or with no insurance at all. Further, poverty and its effects significantly contribute to one's inability to lead a healthy life. In the following section, we will look at the percent of uninsured individuals throughout Vermont. We will also learn more about the health care needs for Addison County residents and the steps the Open Door Clinic is taking to meet those needs.

<h3> Community Voices: Overall Health Quality and Underinsurance in Addison County</h3>

<section>
    <article>
        The 2015 report noted that over half of the community members and local experts interviewed believed "it is easy for most residents to live a healthy life in Addison County." Interviewees mentioned high-quality health services, opportunities for outdoor recreation and physical activity, and an abundance of social support networks.

        Yet, there were still issues relating to health in Addison County that, according to community members, seemed to be growing. For example, a third of the interviewees had seen an increase in opiate usage in Addison County. Further, interviewees who work with children confirm that there are more cases of children on medication for emotional or behavioral issues, which they believe is linked to an increase in disturbances in the classroom and at home, among other possibilities. One interviewee said, "I think the biggest thing is mental health. We just have a huge lack of enough counselors and enough, certainly, psychiatrists. We just do not have enough psychiatrists." Despite the high rates of insurance highlighted in the census data, community members deal with underinsurance. "Even with insurance," stated the report, "one interviewee said she regularly sees people who come to her organization making the choice between paying for necessary medications and paying the rent."

<h3> Community Partner Profile: Open Door Clinic</h3>

<section>
    <article>
        The Open Door Clinic (ODC) provides free healthcare for persons who are uninsured or underinsured in a respectful and culturally sensitive manner. ODC opened in 1990 and was initially a bus that traveled to towns and farms to serve those who needed healthcare. Three years later, in 1993, the Clinic was able to open its first clinic in the town of Middlebury. They have since expanded to another location in Vergennes where they are able to reach more people who need aid. The ODC serves a diverse range of Vermonters, from immigrant farm workers to life-long residents. Regardless of different identities, the ODC is committed to providing the highest quality care to anyone who needs it.

        The services ODC provides include dental health, acute and chronic care (hypertension and diabetes treatments), mental health support, yearly physical exams, and nutrition counseling. In an effort to reach more isolated migrant farmworkers, the ODC has been traveling from farm to farm since 2009 to distribute vaccines, conduct yearly physicals, and provide education on health services in Addison County.
