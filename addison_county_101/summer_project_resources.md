## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create two digital resources that could be used by students, faculty, and staff interested in including updated materials about social and economic inequality into their coursework, teaching, research, and service. The resources will strengthen the Privilege & Poverty Academic Cluster's efforts to address real-world problems throughout the curriculum by emphasizing place-based learning and building connections across courses and experiences. As Middlebury continues developing initiatives on community connected teaching, project-based learning, and experiential-classroom integrations, P&P will offer a centralized location to access local materials and to encourage curricular and co-curricular spaces to share resources.

## Addison County 101

The first resource will be a collection of ready-to-use content about Addison County. The content will focus on topics related to the key themes of P&P gateway, foundations, and capstone courses: poverty, economic inequality, social mobility, race, health, education, labor, migration, food justice, human and cultural geography, punishment, housing, and social services.

To start building this resource, conduct a review of recent academic research that uses Addison County as a case study.  Additional materials could include newspaper articles, government reports, maps, visualizations or photographs, videos, and podcasts. The digital platforms will hopefully be interactive so assembling a breadth of materials would be good. However, in the beginning prioritize scholarly articles and books or book chapters that will be accessible to students if included in a course syllabus. We want materials that use Addison County in their attempts to link theory with evidence. It may be helpful to consult with a librarian to discuss best practices for finding existing literature.

In addition to collecting research and reports, the resource should also centralize local facts and figures from datasets that explore geographic variation in social and economic outcomes. Comparing Addison County to Vermont or the nation would be great. Here are some examples of the datasets to consider using for different topics.

## Privilege, Poverty, and the Pandemic

P&P faculty have begun suggesting resources highlighting their disciplines' perspectives on inequality and the COVID-19 pandemic. This resource will curate those resources.
